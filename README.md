# Website Repo |Â BIP Challenge 1 - Asset Material Tracking Outdoors

## Introduction
Our project revolves around the outdoor tracking of tools and materials at Janssen Pharmaceutica.
We aim to tack both small tools like a hammer
as well as larger items such as forklifts.
While design is not our primary focus, our emphasis has been on ensuring effective functionality.
